#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

## For example's sake, instances of 'n' will = 2. 
## Anything in '' is referential to the questions from Algorithms_Answers. 

a) 'while (a < n * n * n):'
    2 * 2 * 2 = 8

    'a = a + n * n'
     a = 0 + 2 * 2 = 4
     a = 4

     The while loop repeats until 'a' is no longer greater than 'n * n * n'
     Resulting in: 
     a = 12 

    The runtime is O(n) by Iteration 


b)


c)
